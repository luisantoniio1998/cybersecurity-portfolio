## Interview Preparation

### Common Interview Questions & Responses

#### Technical Questions

**Q: "Walk me through how you would respond to a ransomware attack."**

**A**: "I would follow the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle:

*Preparation*: First, I'd verify we have recent backups and incident response contacts readily available.

*Detection & Analysis*: Identify the ransomware variant using IOCs like file extensions, ransom notes, and hash values. Determine patient zero and scope of infection through log analysis and SIEM correlation.

*Containment*: Immediately isolate infected systems from the network to prevent lateral spread. Disable network shares and block C2 communications at the firewall. Document all actions taken.

*Eradication*: Remove the ransomware from all affected systems. I'd likely re-image infected machines rather than attempt cleaning. Verify no persistence mechanisms remain and confirm backups aren't compromised.

*Recovery*: Restore systems from known-good backups in priority order (critical systems first). Validate restored data integrity and monitor for 48 hours before full production use.

*Post-Incident*: Conduct lessons learned session, document findings, identify gaps (like why initial infection succeeded), and implement preventive controls such as email filtering, user training, and offline backups.

In my portfolio, I documented a healthcare clinic ransomware incident following this exact process."

---

**Q: "How would you investigate a suspected data breach?"**

**A**: "My approach would be systematic:

First, I'd *gather initial information*: what was detected, when, and by whom. Review alerts from SIEM, EDR, or user reports.

Second, I'd *analyze logs* to determine:
- What data was accessed (database audit logs, file access logs)
- Who accessed it (user accounts, IP addresses)
- When the access occurred (timeline reconstruction)
- How they accessed it (SQL injection, compromised credentials, insider threat)

For example, in my portfolio I investigated a SQL injection breach where I:
- Reviewed 3 weeks of database logs (500GB) in Splunk
- Identified 2,847 malicious queries targeting customer PII
- Traced the attack back to a web application vulnerability
- Determined 15,000 customer records were potentially exposed

Third, I'd *collect evidence* preserving the chain of custody for potential legal action.

Fourth, I'd *determine scope and impact* for regulatory notification requirements (GDPR 72-hour rule, state breach notification laws).

Finally, I'd *remediate* by patching vulnerabilities, forcing password resets, and implementing compensating controls like a WAF.

Throughout the process, I'd document everything for regulatory reporting and lessons learned."

---

**Q: "What's the difference between TCP and UDP, and when would each be used?"**

**A**: "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented and reliable. It establishes a connection using a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), guarantees delivery through acknowledgments and retransmissions, and ensures in-order delivery. TCP is used for applications where data integrity is critical, like HTTP/HTTPS, email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP), and SSH.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and unreliable. It sends datagrams without establishing a connection, doesn't guarantee delivery or order, and has no acknowledgment mechanism. UDP is used for applications where speed is more important than perfect delivery, like DNS queries, video streaming, VoIP, and online gaming.

From a security perspective, I've analyzed both in Wireshark. For example, I investigated DNS tunneling over UDP port 53, where attackers encoded data in DNS queries to exfiltrate information. I've also seen malware use both TCP for C2 communications (to guarantee command delivery) and UDP for DDoS reflection attacks.

Understanding these protocols is important for firewall rule configuration, IDS signature development, and incident investigation."

---

**Q: "Explain the principle of least privilege and how you've applied it."**

**A**: "The principle of least privilege means users should have only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their job functions - nothing more.

In my portfolio, I applied this principle in multiple projects:

*Linux File Permissions*: I removed unauthorized write access for 'other' users on project files, ensured an archived file was read-only for everyone, and restricted a drafts directory so only the owner could access it. This prevented unauthorized modifications and reduced the attack surface.

*Botium Toys Audit*: I identified that all employees had administrator privileges on workstations and shared accounts were common. I recommended implementing role-based access control (RBAC), removing local admin rights from standard users, eliminating shared accounts, and implementing user account lifecycle management.

*Benefits*:
- Reduces impact of compromised credentials
- Limits lateral movement in a breach
- Prevents accidental or intentional damage by users
- Improves audit trails and accountability
- Supports compliance requirements

*Implementation*:
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- Just-in-time privileged access when needed
- Separation of duties for critical functions
- Default-deny approach to permissions

This principle is foundational to defense-in-depth security strategy."

#### Behavioral Questions

**Q: "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly."**

**A**: "During the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, I had to quickly learn Python programming to automate security tasks, despite having limited prior programming experience.

*Situation*: The course required developing a Python script to manage an IP allow list for access control.

*Task*: I needed to understand file I/O, string manipulation, list operations, and control flow within a week to complete the project.

*Action*: I took a structured approach:
- Completed all course videos and hands-on labs systematically
- Practiced each concept (file handling, loops, conditionals) with my own examples
- Broke down the project into smaller components and tested each separately
- Read Python documentation for methods like .split(), .join(), and .remove()
- Debugged issues by using print statements to understand program flow

*Result*: I successfully developed a functional Python algorithm that:
- Opens and reads an allow list file
- Converts string to list for manipulation
- Iterates through a removal list and removes matching IPs
- Writes the updated list back to the file
- Follows PEP 8 style guidelines with proper documentation

The script is now in my portfolio and demonstrates my ability to learn new technologies quickly and apply them to practical security problems. I continue using Python for personal security automation projects."

**Q: "Describe a time you had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical audience."**

**A**: "*Situation*: In my Botium Toys security audit project, I needed to communicate critical security findings to fictional stakeholders including executives who wouldn't understand technical jargon.

*Task*: Explain why spending $13K-$24K on security controls was necessary when there had been no recent breaches.

*Action*: I created a stakeholder memorandum that:
- Started with an executive summary highlighting business impact, not technical details
- Explained risks in business terms: 'loss of ability to accept credit cards' rather than 'PCI DSS non-compliance'
- Used analogies: described network segmentation as 'building walls inside the building, so if one room is compromised, the entire building isn't accessible'
- Quantified risks: 'average small business data breach costs $120K-$200K; prevention costs $13K-$24K'
- Provided clear recommendations with priorities (immediate, high, medium) instead of overwhelming with technical specifications

*Result*: The memorandum effectively communicated the importance of security investments by focusing on business outcomes like:
- Maintaining payment processing capability (survival)
- Avoiding regulatory fines (financial impact)
- Protecting customer trust (reputation)
- Ensuring business continuity (operations)

This experience taught me that security is ultimately about enabling business objectives securely, not just implementing technical controls."
