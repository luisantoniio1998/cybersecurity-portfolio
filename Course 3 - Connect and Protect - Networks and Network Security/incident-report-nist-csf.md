## Incident Summary

**Organization**: Multimedia company providing web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses

**Date/Time of Incident**: [Date/Time]

**Incident Type**: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack

**Duration**: 2 hours

**Attack Vector**: ICMP flood attack

**Systems Affected**: Internal network, all network services

**Incident Status**: Resolved

---

## Incident Description

The organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that compromised internal network availability for approximately two hours. Network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets. The high volume of ICMP traffic overwhelmed network resources, preventing normal internal network traffic from accessing any network resources.

### Attack Details
- **Attack Type**: ICMP flood DDoS attack
- **Entry Point**: Unconfigured firewall
- **Root Cause**: Firewall misconfiguration allowed unrestricted ICMP packets to enter the network
- **Impact**: Complete disruption of internal network services and operations

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework Analysis

### 1. IDENTIFY

**What type of attack occurred?**

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using ICMP flooding. The attack exploited an unconfigured firewall to send a massive volume of ICMP ping requests into the company's network, overwhelming network bandwidth and resources.

**Systems and assets affected:**

- **Network Infrastructure**: Routers, switches, firewalls
- **Internal Network Services**: File servers, application servers, internal websites
- **Network Connectivity**: All internal network communication channels
- **Business Operations**: All network-dependent business functions including:
  - Web design project access
  - Graphic design file sharing
  - Email and communication systems
  - Social media management tools
  - Customer-facing services

**Vulnerabilities exploited:**

- **Unconfigured Firewall**: Primary vulnerability - firewall lacked proper rules to filter or rate-limit ICMP traffic
- **No ICMP Filtering**: Absence of ICMP packet filtering allowed unrestricted ping requests
- **Lack of Rate Limiting**: No mechanisms in place to throttle excessive traffic
- **No Intrusion Detection**: Absence of monitoring to detect abnormal traffic patterns early

**Impact Assessment:**

- **Business Impact**: 2-hour complete network outage affecting all employees and operations
- **Financial Impact**: Loss of productivity, potential client delivery delays
- **Reputational Impact**: Potential client dissatisfaction due to service delays
- **Data Impact**: No data loss or confidentiality breach, availability compromised
