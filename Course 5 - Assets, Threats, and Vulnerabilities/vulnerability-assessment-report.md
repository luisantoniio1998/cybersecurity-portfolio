Multiple systems are using default or weak administrator passwords, including the wireless router (admin/admin) and server administrator account (company name as password).

**Risk**:
- Unauthorized administrative access to critical systems
- Complete network compromise
- Data theft or destruction
- Ransomware deployment

**Affected Systems**:

2. Implement strong password policy:
   - Minimum 14 characters
   - Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
   - No dictionary words or company information
3. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts
4. Use a password manager for secure password storage

**Priority**: IMMEDIATE (within 24 hours)

#### 3. No Network Segmentation
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**CVSS Score**: 8.5

**Description**:
All systems (employee workstations, server, POS system, guest WiFi) exist on a single flat network (192.168.1.0/24) with no segmentation or VLANs.

**Risk**:
- Lateral movement after initial compromise
- Guest network users can access internal resources
- POS system compromise can affect entire network
- Single point of failure for security controls
